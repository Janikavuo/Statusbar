# Statusbar
Statusbar is the upmost bar in your mobile app displaying time, connection status,
battery life, etc. It will be displayed on React native app by default. You may effect on
what is displayed on statusbar and you need to take care, that other content is not
overlapping with the statusbar.

As said by default statusbar is displayed and content is not overlapping with it, since
default code has alingItems: ‘center’ definition as a style.
